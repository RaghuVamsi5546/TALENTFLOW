# TalentFlow - Mini Hiring Platform

A modern, front-end-only React application for managing jobs, candidates, and assessments. Built with React 18, JavaScript, Vite, and MSW for API simulation.

## Features

### Jobs Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete job postings
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Reorder jobs with optimistic updates and rollback on failure
- **Archive/Unarchive**: Toggle job status between active and archived
- **Filtering & Search**: Filter by status and search by title
- **Pagination**: Server-like pagination with 10 jobs per page
- **Deep Linking**: Direct access to job details via `/jobs/:jobId`

### Candidates Management
- **Virtualized List**: Efficiently display 1000+ candidates
- **Dual Views**: Switch between table and kanban board views
- **Search & Filter**: Search by name/email and filter by stage
- **Kanban Board**: Drag-and-drop candidates between stages (applied → screen → tech → offer → hired/rejected)
- **Candidate Profiles**: View detailed candidate information with status timeline
- **Notes System**: Add notes to candidates with timestamps

### Assessments
- **Assessment Builder**: Create multi-section assessments with various question types
- **Question Types**: 
  - Short text (with max length validation)
  - Long text
  - Single choice
  - Multi-choice
  - Numeric (with min/max range)
  - File upload (stub)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaghuVamsi5546/TALENTFLOW
   cd HR-platfrom-main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   ```bash
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   ```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are simulated with MSW and store data in IndexedDB.

### Jobs
- `GET /api/jobs?search=&status=&page=&pageSize=&sort=` - List jobs with pagination
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create new job
- `PATCH /api/jobs/:id` - Update job
- `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/reorder` - Reorder jobs

### Candidates
- `GET /api/candidates?search=&stage=&page=&pageSize=` - List candidates
- `PATCH /api/candidates/:id` - Update candidate stage
- `GET /api/candidates/:id/timeline` - Get candidate status timeline

### Assessments
- `GET /api/assessments/:jobId` - Get assessment for job
- `PUT /api/assessments/:jobId` - Create/update assessment
- `POST /api/assessments/:jobId/submit` - Submit assessment responses

## Seed Data

The application automatically seeds the database on first load with:
- **25 Jobs**: Mix of active and archived positions with various tags
- **1,000 Candidates**: Randomly distributed across jobs and stages
- **3 Assessments**: Complete assessments with 10+ questions each
- **Timeline Events**: Sample status transitions for candidates

## Data Persistence

All data is persisted locally using IndexedDB through Dexie:
- Jobs, candidates, assessments, and timeline events are stored locally
- Data persists across browser sessions
- MSW intercepts API calls and reads/writes to IndexedDB
- On page refresh, data is restored from IndexedDB

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: 5-10% simulated error rate on write operations
- **Validation**: Client-side validation for required fields and unique constraints
- **Toast Notifications**: User-friendly error and success messages
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with rollback on failure
- **Retry Logic**: Failed operations can be retried

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **File Upload**: File upload is a stub implementation (no actual file storage)
2. **Mentions**: @mention suggestions are rendered but not fully implemented
3. **Conditional Questions**: Framework is in place but not fully utilized
4. **Real-time Sync**: No real-time synchronization between tabs
5. **Search Performance**: Large dataset searches may have slight delays
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Some features (like kanban board) may need adjustment on very small screens

## Technical Decisions

### Why MSW?
- Provides realistic API simulation with latency and error rates
- Allows testing error scenarios without a real backend
- Easy to extend with new endpoints
- Works in browser without additional server setup

### Why Dexie?
- Simple, promise-based IndexedDB wrapper
- Excellent querying and indexing
- Efficient data management
- Automatic schema management

### Why React Query?
- Powerful data fetching and caching
- Automatic background refetching
- Built-in error handling and retry logic
- Excellent developer experience

### State Management
- React Query for server state (API data)
- React hooks for local UI state
- No need for Redux/Zustand for this scope

### Pure JavaScript (No TypeScript)
- Simpler setup and faster development
- Reduced build complexity
- JSDoc for optional type hints
- Easier for rapid prototyping

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Pagination**: Limits data fetched per request
2. **Virtualization Ready**: Structure supports virtual scrolling for large lists
3. **Query Caching**: React Query caches data to reduce API calls
4. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirmation
5. **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels where appropriate
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Form labels and error messages

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Modern browsers with IndexedDB support

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Backend Integration**: Replace MSW with actual API
2. **Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization
3. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options
4. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk candidate updates and job management
5. **Analytics**: Hiring funnel analytics and reporting
6. **Export**: Export candidates and assessments to CSV/PDF
7. **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for status changes
8. **Integrations**: Slack, email, calendar integrations
9. **Mobile App**: React Native version
10. **Accessibility**: Enhanced accessibility features

## Deployment
